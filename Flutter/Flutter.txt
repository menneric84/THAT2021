Matthew Ridley (@matt_ridley)

What is Flutter
    - Introduced by google in 2015
    - Dart
    - 1.0 released in 2018
    - Flutter 2 came out in March 2021
        - Desktop support for windows, linux, and macOS (early access)
        - Access to embedded (early access)
        - Can deploy to web
        - Null safety

Why Flutter
    - Stable
    - Native - feels Native
    - Open Source
    - Hot reload

    Why not?
        - Need to learn Dart
            - C Language

Let's See it in Action
    - VS Code 
    - Android Studio works as well
    - Can deploy straight to web without additional changes
        -*** Is it accessible?
    - pubspec.yaml
        - libraries
        - envs
        - versioning
        - specify assets folder location
    - Besides changing icons the speaker rarely needs to do anything platform specific
    - pub.dev contains libraries for flutter 
        - Anything over 80% and is active in the last few months are good candidates
        - Contains a popularity rating
        - contains installation instructions
        - Always check out the readme.md
    - vs code should automatically pick up pubspec.yaml updates
    - lib directory contains all flutter code
        - main.dart is only file outside of a directory (this is just a standard practice)
    - Async based on promises and Futures
    -
