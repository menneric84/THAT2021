Richard Fichtner (@RichardFichtner)

- Basics
    - Build tool
    - Dependency management
    - Convention over conifguration
    - Standard project layout
    - Maven has a lot of defaults whereas ant needs conifguration
- Inheritance
    - Parent Poms
    - Super Poms
- clean install is outdated
    use verify instead
- install
    - install the package into the local repository
- Direct dependences
    - libs that are directly used
- Indirect dependencies
    - dependencies that are brought in by other dependencies
- mvnd - this may make builds faster
    - 2 mins -> 1.20 mins
