Levels of Conformances - https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html

A - Should automatically hit A. If we aren't here we should be.
AA - This is what you should strive for. This is the standard.
AAA - Difficult to hit. 9/10 times this doesn't happen. This is normally cost prohibitive.

These names will be changing to bronze, silver, and gold in the future

Testing Tools

- Axe Confore (deque)
    - browser extension
    - chrome
    - axe can be built into our build pipeline
        *** TODO - Can we do this for MGL?

- Lighthouse
    - Chromium under the hood

Semantic Markup
    - By default is accessible
    - "By default HTML is accessible. As developers, our job is not f*** it up."
    - header, nav, footer, section, form, aside, main, button

ReachUI - Accessible JS design system

Forms
    - Esnure forms are logical and easy to use 
    - Ensure the flow makes sense with the keyboard
    - Radio buttons should be used for items where only one option can be chosen
    - Use checkboxes when multiple items can be selected

    - Text Inputs
        - use label elements for Inputs
    - Text Areas
        - Same as text Inputs
    - Radio buttons
        - Use a fieldset and legend
        - each radio should have a label and input with a unique id
    - ***TODO - check MGL for semantic markup. My guess is we are off on this.

What is focus?
    - The visual representation that something is being interacted with on the page.
    - Why does focus matter?
        - https://twoblindbrothers.com
    - Don't remove focus
    - focus-within - used to change when you have focus within a form

ARIA
    - Non contextual elements get meaning to the screen reader
    - aria should only be used when semantic elements cannot be used
    - First Rule of ARIA
        - Don't use ARIA
            - Should always be considered the second option after semantic markup
    - Aria controls the rendering of their (the users) non-visual experience

Screen reader   
    - When testing use an extension or find a way to put yourself in the user's shoes
    - Ex: put something over monitor so you are forced to navigate like your targetted user
